repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Answer:

Question: Why might you want to always pull changes
 manually rather than having Git automatically 
 stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

make it public on my repo on GitHub. 

Question: Describe the differences between forks, 
clones, and branches. When would you use one instead 
of another?

Answer:

This term is used for GitHub only.

on another repo on GitHub (or a working directory).

or offline. allows you to try modifications to your project.
